        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>This processor distributes FlowFiles to downstream
            processors based on a distribution strategy. The user may select the strategy "round robin", the
            strategy "next available", or "load distribution service". If using the round robin
            strategy, the default is to assign each destination (i.e., relationship) a weighting of 1
            (evenly distributed). However, the user may add optional properties to change this weighting. When 
            adding a property, the name must be a positive integer between 1 and the number of relationships (inclusive).
            For example, if Number of Relationships has a value of 8 and a property is added with the name 5
            and the value 10, then relationship 5 (among the 8) will receive 10
            FlowFiles in each iteration instead of 1. All other relationships will receive 1 FlowFile in each iteration.
        </p>
        <strong>Properties:</strong>
    <p>In the list below, the names of required properties appear
        in bold. Any other properties (not in bold) are considered optional.
        If a property has a default value, it is indicated. If a property
        supports the use of the NiFi Expression Language (or simply,
        "expression language"), that is also indicated.</p>

    <p>
        <strong>Relationships:</strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>1
            <ul>
                <li>By default, there is one relationship, named 1. The number
                    of relationships is determined by the value of the &lt;Number of
                    Relationships&gt; property.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
