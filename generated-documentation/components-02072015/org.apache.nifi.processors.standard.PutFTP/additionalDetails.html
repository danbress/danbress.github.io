        <p>
            <strong>Optional User-Defined Properties:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>pre.cmd.#
                <ul>
                    <li>Optional properties of this type can be added by the user and should be used for <strong>VERY
                            RARE</strong> cases only. You will know when you need to use it when the recipient specifies that you must
                        send FTP commands prior to the transfer. Otherwise, do not use it. You may add these optional properties
                        to send any commands to the FTP server before the file is actually transferred (before the put command).
                        This option is only available for the PutFTP processor, as only FTP has this functionality. This is
                        essentially the same as sending quote commands to an FTP server from the command line.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>NOTE</strong>: While this is the same as sending a quote command, it is very important that
                        you leave off the “quote” part of the command from the text value you enter in. For example, if you want
                        to mimic the command line ftp command quote stat you would give the text value of stat. You have the
                        option of sending a number of commands to the FTP server before the file is sent. If you have only one
                        command, then the name of the optional parameter will be pre.cmd.1. If you have a second command, then
                        the next optional parameter you give is pre.cmd.2, and so on. There is no limit to the number of pre
                        commands you can send. The commands will be sent in the order of their number, so pre.cmd.1 will be sent
                        first, pre.cmd.2 will be sent next, etc. This is true regardless of what order they are added to the
                        processor properties. The property names determine the order.</li>
                    <li><strong>NOTE</strong>: If the optional property name does not follow the pattern pre.cmd.<em>integer</em>
                        - then the command will not be sent. If a command is given which is not recognized by the server, then
                        that will be logged.</li>
                    <li>Supports expression language: true. FlowFile attributes can be used in commands using the expression language</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>post.cmd.#
                <ul>
                    <li>Optional properties of this type can be added by the user and should be used for <strong>VERY
                            RARE</strong> cases only. You will know when you need to use it when the recipient specifies that you must
                        send FTP commands after the transfer. Otherwise, do not use it. These are the same as the pre commands.
                        (See pre commands above) except that these commands are sent after the file transfer.
