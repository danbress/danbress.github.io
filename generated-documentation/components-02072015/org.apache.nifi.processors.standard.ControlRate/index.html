Any other properties (not in bold) are considered optional. The table also indicates any default values, whether a property supports the <a href="../../html/expression-language-guide.html">NiFi Expression Language</a>, and whether a property is considered "sensitive", meaning that its value will be encrypted. Before entering a value in a sensitive property, ensure that the <strong>nifi.properties</strong> file has an entry for the property <strong>nifi.sensitive.props.key</strong>.</p><table><tr><th>Name</th><th>Default Value</th><th>Valid Values</th><th>Description</th></tr><tr><td><strong>Rate Control Criteria</strong></td><td>data rate</td><td><ul><li>data rate</li><li>flowfile count</li><li>attribute value</li></ul></td><td>Indicates the criteria that is used to control the throughput rate. Changing this value resets the rate counters.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Maximum Rate</strong></td><td></td><td></td><td>The maximum rate at which data should pass through this processor. The format of this property is expected to be a positive integer, or a Data Size (such as '1 MB') if Rate Control Criteria is set to 'data rate'.</td></tr><tr><td>Rate Controlled Attribute</td><td></td><td></td><td>The name of an attribute whose values build toward the rate limit if Rate Control Criteria is set to 'attribute value'. The value of the attribute referenced by this property must be a positive integer, or the FlowFile will be routed to failure. This value is ignored if Rate Control Criteria is not set to 'attribute value'. Changing this value resets the rate counters.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Time Duration</strong></td><td>1 min</td><td></td><td>The amount of time to which the Maximum Data Size and Maximum Number of Files pertains. Changing this value resets the rate counters.</td></tr><tr><td>Grouping Attribute</td><td></td><td></td><td>By default, a single "throttle" is used for all FlowFiles. If this value is specified, a separate throttle is used for each value specified by the attribute with this name. Changing this value resets the rate counters.</td></tr></table><h3>Relationships: </h3><table><tr><th>Name</th><th>Description</th></tr><tr><td>success</td><td>All FlowFiles are transferred to this relationship</td></tr></table></body></html>
