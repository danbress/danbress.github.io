Optional properties are to be added such that the name of the property is the name of a FlowFile Attribute to consider and the value of the property is a regular expression that, if matched by the attribute value, will cause that attribute to be used as part of the hash. If the regular expression contains a capturing group, only the value of the capturing group will be used.</p><p><a href="additionalDetails.html">Additional Details...</a></p><h3>Tags: </h3><p>attributes, hash</p><h3>Properties: </h3><p>In the list below, the names of required properties appear in <strong>bold</strong>. Any other properties (not in bold) are considered optional. The table also indicates any default values, whether a property supports the <a href="../../html/expression-language-guide.html">NiFi Expression Language</a>, and whether a property is considered "sensitive", meaning that its value will be encrypted.
