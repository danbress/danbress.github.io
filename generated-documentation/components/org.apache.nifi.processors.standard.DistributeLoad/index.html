If using the Round Robin strategy, the default is to assign each destination a weighting of 1 (evenly distributed). However, optional propertiescan be added to the change this; adding a property with the name '5' and value '10' means that the relationship with name '5' will be receive 10 FlowFiles in each iteration instead of 1.</p><p><a href="additionalDetails.html">Additional Details...</a></p><p>Tags: distribute, load balance, route, round robin, weighted</p><p><strong>Properties: </strong></p><p>In the list below, the names of required properties appear in bold.
