Regular Expressions are added as User-Defined Properties where the name of the property is the name of the relationship and the value is a Regular Expression to match against the FlowFile content. User-Defined properties do support the Attribute Expression Language, but the results are interpreted as literal values, not Regular Expressions</p><p>Tags: route, content, regex, regular expression, regexp</p><p><strong>Properties: </strong></p><p>In the list below, the names of required properties appear in <strong>bold</strong>.
