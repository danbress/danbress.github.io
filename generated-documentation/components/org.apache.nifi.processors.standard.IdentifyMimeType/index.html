If the MIME Type can be identified, an attribute with the name 'mime.type' is added with the value being the MIME Type. If the MIME Type cannot be determined, the value will be set to 'application/octet-stream'. Some MIME Types require reading a significant amount of data; for these MIME Types, their identification is optional. The algorithm may have to read the entire contents of the file for each type of identification.</p><p><a href="additionalDetails.html">Additional Details...</a></p><p>Tags: compression, gzip, bzip2, zip, MIME, mime.type, file, identify</p><p><strong>Properties: </strong></p><p>In the list below, the names of required properties appear in bold.
