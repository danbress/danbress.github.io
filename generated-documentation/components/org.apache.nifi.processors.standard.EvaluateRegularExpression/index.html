The results of those Regular Expressions are assigned to FlowFile Attributes.  Regular Expressions are entered by adding user-defined properties; the name of the property maps to the Attribute Name into which the result will be placed.  The value of the property must be a valid Regular Expressions with exactly one capturing group.  If the Regular Expression matches more than once, only the first match will be used.  If any provided Regular Expression matches, the FlowFile(s) will be routed to 'matched'. If no provided Regular Expression matches, the FlowFile will be routed to 'unmatched' and no attributes will be applied to the FlowFile.</p><p>Tags: evaluate, Text, Regular Expression, regex, experimental</p><p><strong>Properties: </strong></p><p>In the list below, the names of required properties appear in <strong>bold</strong>. Anyother properties (not in bold) are considered optional. The table also indicates any default values, whether a property supports the <a href="../../html/expression-language-guide.html">NiFi Expression Language (or simply EL)</a>, and whether a property is considered "sensitive", meaning that its value will be encrypted. Before entering a value in a sensitive property, ensure that the <strong>nifi.properties</strong> file has an entry for the property <strong>nifi.sensitive.props.key</strong>.</p><table><tr><th>Name</th><th>Description</th><th>Default Value</th><th>Valid Values</th><th><a href="../../html/expression-language-guide.html">EL</a></th><th>Sensitive</th></tr><tr><td><strong>Character Set</strong></td><td>The Character Set in which the file is encoded</td><td>UTF-8</td><td></td><td>No</td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Maximum Buffer Size</strong></td><td>Specifies the maximum amount of data to buffer (per file) in order to apply the regular expressions.
