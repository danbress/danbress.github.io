The format of this property is expected to be a positive integer, or a Data Size (such as '1 MB') if Rate Control Criteria is set to 'data rate'.</td><td></td><td></td><td>No</td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td>Rate Controlled Attribute</td><td>The name of an attribute whose values build toward the rate limit if Rate Control Criteria is set to 'attribute value'. The value of the attribute referenced by this property must be a positive integer, or the FlowFile will be routed to failure. This value is ignored if Rate Control Criteria is not set to 'attribute value'. Changing this value resets the rate counters.</td><td></td><td></td><td>No</td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Time Duration</strong></td><td>The amount of time to which the Maximum Data Size and Maximum Number of Files pertains. Changing this value resets the rate counters.</td><td>1 min</td><td></td><td>No</td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td>Grouping Attribute</td><td>By default, a single "throttle" is used for all FlowFiles. If this value is specified, a separate throttle is used for each value specified by the attribute with this name. Changing this value resets the rate counters.</td><td></td><td></td><td>No</td><td>No</td></tr></table><p><strong>Relationships: </strong></p><table><tr><th>Name</th><th>Description</th></tr><tr><td>success</td><td>All FlowFiles are transferred to this relationship</td></tr></table></body></html>
