The results of those XPaths are assigned to FlowFile Attributes or are written to the content of the FlowFile itself, depending on configuration of the Processor. XPaths are entered by adding user-defined properties; the name of the property maps to the Attribute Name into which the result will be placed (if the Destination is flowfile-content; otherwise, the property name is ignored). The value of the property must be a valid XPath expression. If the XPath evaluates to more than one node and the Return Type is set to 'nodeset' (either directly, or via 'auto-detect' with a Destination of 'flowfile-content', the FlowFile will be unmodified and will be routed to failure. If the XPath does not evaluate to a Node, the FlowFile will be routed to 'unmatched' without having its contents modified. If Destination is flowfile-attribute and the expression matches nothing, attributes will be created with empty strings as the value, and the FlowFile will always be routed to 'matched'</p><p><a href="additionalDetails.html">Additional Details...</a></p><p>Tags: XML, evaluate, XPath</p><p><strong>Properties: </strong></p><p>In the list below, the names of required properties appear in bold.
