Optional properties are to be added such that the name of the property is the name of a FlowFile Attribute to consider and the value of the property is a regular expression that, if matched by the attribute value, will cause that attribute to be used as part of the hash. If the regular expression contains a capturing group, only the value of the capturing group will be used.</p><p><a href="additionalDetails.html">Additional Details...</a></p><p>Tags: attributes, hash</p><p><strong>Properties: </strong></p><p>In the list below, the names of required properties appear in bold.
