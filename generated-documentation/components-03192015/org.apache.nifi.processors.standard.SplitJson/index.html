Each generated FlowFile is comprised of an element of the specified array and transferred to relationship 'split,' with the original file transferred to the 'original' relationship. If the specified JsonPath is not found or does not evaluate to an array element, the original file is routed to 'failure' and no files are generated.</p><h3>Tags: </h3><p>json, split, jsonpath</p><h3>Properties: </h3><p>In the list below, the names of required properties appear in <strong>bold</strong>. Any other properties (not in bold) are considered optional. The table also indicates any default values, whether a property supports the <a href="../../html/expression-language-guide.html">NiFi Expression Language</a>, and whether a property is considered "sensitive", meaning that its value will be encrypted. Before entering a value in a sensitive property, ensure that the <strong>nifi.properties</strong> file has an entry for the property <strong>nifi.sensitive.props.key</strong>.</p><table><tr><th>Name</th><th>Default Value</th><th>Valid Values</th><th>Description</th></tr><tr><td><strong>JsonPath Expression</strong></td><td></td><td></td><td>A JsonPath expression that indicates the array element to split into JSON/scalar fragments.</td></tr></table><h3>Relationships: </h3><table><tr><th>Name</th><th>Description</th></tr><tr><td>original</td><td>The original FlowFile that was split into segments.
