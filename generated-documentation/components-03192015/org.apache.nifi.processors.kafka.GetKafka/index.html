The table also indicates any default values, whether a property supports the <a href="../../html/expression-language-guide.html">NiFi Expression Language</a>, and whether a property is considered "sensitive", meaning that its value will be encrypted. Before entering a value in a sensitive property, ensure that the <strong>nifi.properties</strong> file has an entry for the property <strong>nifi.sensitive.props.key</strong>.</p><table><tr><th>Name</th><th>Default Value</th><th>Valid Values</th><th>Description</th></tr><tr><td><strong>ZooKeeper Connection String</strong></td><td></td><td></td><td>The Connection String to use in order to connect to ZooKeeper. This is often a comma-separated list of &lt;host&gt;:&lt;port&gt; combinations.

A longer time period will result in better overall performance but can result in more data duplication if a NiFi node is lost</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Batch Size</strong></td><td>1</td><td></td><td>Specifies the maximum number of messages to combine into a single FlowFile. These messages will be concatenated together with the &lt;Message Demarcator&gt; string placed between the content of each message. If the messages from Kafka should not be concatenated together, leave this value at 1.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Message Demarcator</strong></td><td>\n</td><td></td><td>Specifies the characters to use in order to demarcate multiple messages from Kafka. If the &lt;Batch Size&gt; property is set to 1, this value is ignored. Otherwise, for each two subsequent messages in the batch, this value will be placed in between them.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Client Name</strong></td><td>NiFi-</td><td></td><td>Client Name to use when communicating with Kafka</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Kafka Communications Timeout</strong></td><td>30 secs</td><td></td><td>The amount of time to wait for a response from Kafka before determining that there is a communications error</td></tr><tr><td><strong>ZooKeeper Communications Timeout</strong></td><td>30 secs</td><td></td><td>The amount of time to wait for a response from ZooKeeper before determining that there is a communications error</td></tr></table><h3>Relationships: </h3><table><tr><th>Name</th><th>Description</th></tr><tr><td>success</td><td>All FlowFiles that are created are routed to this relationship</td></tr></table><h3>Reads Attributes: </h3>None specified.<h3>Writes Attributes: </h3><table><tr><th>Name</th><th>Description</th></tr><tr><td>kafka.topic</td><td>The name of the Kafka Topic from which the message was received</td></tr><tr><td>kafka.key</td><td>The key of the Kafka message, if it exists and batch size is 1.
