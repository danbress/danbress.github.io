Regular Expressions are added as User-Defined Properties where the name of the property is the name of the relationship and the value is a Regular Expression to match against the FlowFile content. User-Defined properties do support the Attribute Expression Language, but the results are interpreted as literal values, not Regular Expressions</p><h3>Tags: </h3><p>route, content, regex, regular expression, regexp</p><h3>Properties: </h3><p>In the list below, the names of required properties appear in <strong>bold</strong>. Anyother properties (not in bold) are considered optional. The table also indicates any default values, whether a property supports the <a href="../../html/expression-language-guide.html">NiFi Expression Language (or simply EL)</a>, and whether a property is considered "sensitive", meaning that its value will be encrypted. Before entering a value in a sensitive property, ensure that the <strong>nifi.properties</strong> file has an entry for the property <strong>nifi.sensitive.props.key</strong>.</p><table><tr><th>Name</th><th>Default Value</th><th>Valid Values</th><th><a href="../../html/expression-language-guide.html">Expression Language</a></th></tr><tr><td><strong>Match Requirement</strong> <img src="../../html/images/iconInfo.png" alt="Specifies whether the entire content of the file must match the regular expression exactly, or if any part of the file (up to Content Buffer Size) can contain the regular expression in order to be considered a match"></img></td><td>content must match exactly</td><td><ul><li>content must match exactly</li><li>content must contain match</li></ul></td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Character Set</strong> <img src="../../html/images/iconInfo.png" alt="The Character Set in which the file is encoded"></img></td><td>UTF-8</td><td></td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Content Buffer Size</strong> <img src="../../html/images/iconInfo.png" alt="Specifies the maximum amount of data to buffer in order to apply the regular expressions.
